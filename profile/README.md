# Welcome to TCP-Lab's Organization

## Who are you?
We are a small team of bioinformaticians working for the University of Turin, based in Turin, Italy. Our team is outlined below.
We are part of a bigger organization, the Turin Cell Physiology Lab (TCP-Lab), where we study a wide range of subjects, but mostly centered around cancer and general physiology.
You can find CMA-Lab's ResearchGate page [here](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Luca-Munaron-Lab).

## Where are you?
We are based in the Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, in Via Accademia Albertina, 13, Turin, Italy.

## What do you do?
We are currently interested in understanding the role of ion channels and transporters in Cancer and other diseases. Being physiologists by heart, we are mostly interested in the physiological changes of cancer.
